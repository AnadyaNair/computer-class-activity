*Hello! I am Anadya Nair, the developer of the website, of which you want the source code. <br>
It is as simple to use github repositories as you open a folder and its files. <br>
As you came here, just click on the files you want to see. <br>
For example, index.html; you will be redirected on that file. <br>
And to come back here, click on the blue coloured computer-class-activity text on that page. <br> <br>
There are the following files uploaded here:* <br>
* index.html
* style.css
* about.html
* aboutC.css
* ztext.min.js
* Seasons - Delicate Steve.mp3
* double-arrow-dwon.png
* anadya nair(2).jpeg

## Thank you!
