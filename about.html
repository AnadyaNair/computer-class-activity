        Yo! over there, welcome to Anadya's class activity website with a topic of personal website.
        <br> This site was made for a school project, and is copy-protected. The website has 2 webpages,
        <br> along with an external github repository link to view the source code of this site.
        The programming languages <br> used in building are - HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript [version-no-ideaüòù].
        <br> <br>  What is a personal website ? <br>
        Personal web pages are world wide web pages created by an individual to contain 
       <br> content of a personal nature rather than content pertaining to a company, organization 
       <br> or institution. ... Many personal pages only include information of interest to friends 
       <br> and family of the author.
       <br> Time taken for development - almost a week? ü§î
